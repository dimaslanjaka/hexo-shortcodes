## About Minima
Minima is an undoubtedly simple and lightweight dark/light mode theme for Hexo. I created this from scratch using [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/) boilerplate. It only uses CSS and Vanilla JS, without using unnecessary third-party 'render-blocking' libraries.

### Simplicity
Simplicity is a must! When I decided to move to Hexo for my personal blogging platform, the main reason was to find a simple and clean design, no fancy looks, unnecessary images and colors either. I'd like to have a blog that focuses on the content of my posts rather than turning readers attention to a 'cluttered' user interface. I found lots of beautiful themes on the Hexo themes page, but finally I decided to make my own.

### Lightweight
This 'lightweight' means the theme uses as few design stuff as possible. Fewer JavaScript and CSS files. Minima only uses Skeleton for the CSS-boilerplate and [nanobar.js](https://nanobar.jacoborus.codes/) for the top loading bar. The following is the 'gross' performance of my blog with the Minima theme:

### Customization
Minima uses vanilla JavaScript, vanilla CSS, and [EJS](https://ejs.co/). So it will be very easy for everyone to edit and customize the theme.
